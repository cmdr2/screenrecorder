# Screen Recorder

A Python-based screen recording application with video editing capabilities.

Made because I'm an idiot, and didn't see that the Windows Snipping Tool has screen video-recording.

But it was fun to learn Tkinter and build something real with it.

Also ended up building [tkinter-videoplayer](https://github.com/cmdr2/tkinter-videoplayer), which is a useful video player component for Tkinter. In this case, yes, there are alternative components, but they either don't work or require compilation on end-user PCs.
